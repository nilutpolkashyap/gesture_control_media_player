## About  
It is a gesture-controlled media player that detects hand gestures and then executes commands. It is able to recognize hand gestures for executing commands such as Play , pause, 10 s forward, 10 s backward, Volume UP, Volume DOWN.

We used OpenCV and Mediapipe for capturing the images and recognition of the hand gestures. 

Finally we deployed the model on a Raspberry Pi 4 which can be used by anyone by just plugging it into a TV or monitor and to play media such as movies.  

## Software Used
